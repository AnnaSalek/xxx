## A few words about me:
* My name is **Ania**. I live in Warsaw but I grew up in a little township in Silesia and moved to capital when I was 18 due to family reasons
* I studied management and, later on, English philology with German language
* I work as a written translator and my language pairs are **EN/DE =>PL**; I specialize in technical (mainly instruction manuals) and marketing translations
* I attach great importance to **quality and integrity**, even if it sounds cliché

## Environments I like to work in:
* I usually work **remotely** but I can freely switch to **work on-site**
* Since I get distracted easily, I find helpful when I can work in a **peaceful environment**
* I get dehydrated quickly, especially in air-conditioned spaces, so I have to drink a lot of water and use moisturizing drops and sprays

## Preferred working hours:

* **I’m not an early bird** so in a perfect world I would start work around noon and finish around 8 PM
* For obvious reasons I work in standard business hours so **between 9 am and 5 pm**

## Communication preferences:

* The easiest way to contact me is **via [e-mail](mailto:a.j.salek@wp.pl)**. I’m not a huge fan of instant messaging.
* In urgent matters simply **text me** on my mobile phone and I’ll try to answer you ASAP; in very urgent cases **feel free to call me**.

## Preferred ways to receive feedback:

* In written form with explanatory statement and examples
* **Suggestions for improvements**

## Things I need:

* Personal space, clear rules

## Things I love:

* Peace of mind, good food (I’m very **picky** about things I eat but I'm NOT on a diet  )
* Art and paintings (I don’t have a favourite genre, I simply like beautiful things that please my senses)

## If I were an animated gif/meme/animal/song, I would be...

## My favorite saying:

* I don’t have one of these

## Other things I want you to know about me:

* A hungry Pole is an angry Pole, **a hungry Ania is angry Ania**. I think this is best illustrated by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERqZQte4W_4/) video (the best part starts at 0:13) 

* I'm **ALWAYS** paying attention even when you think I'm not
* I'm an observer of the environment I live in and people around me
* In my spare time I like decorating cookies with Royal Icing (you can see a short introduction [here](https://annasalek.github.io/Royal_Icing/), but it's still under construction)
